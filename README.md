## 📖 About

**Blog Club** is my second Flutter practice project. Unlike my first project (which was a simple UI), this one focuses on **Advanced UI concepts**.

I am building this based on an educational course, but I am refactoring the code to use the latest **Material 3** standards and updated Flutter practices.

## 🎯 Learning Focus

- **Advanced UI:** Moving beyond basics to build complex and responsive layouts.
- **Material 3 Migration:** Updating legacy code to use modern standards.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run `flutter run` to start the app.
